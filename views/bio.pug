          p Pranav Rajpurkar is a 5th year PhD candidate in the Stanford Machine Learning Group co-advised by Andrew Ng and Percy Liang. His research interest is in applying artificial intelligence (AI) and computational techniques to tackle real world problems in medicine. His PhD work has led to the development of high-performance algorithms for clinical medicine (HeadXNet, CheXNet, CheXNeXt, MRNet), and large datasets that have facilitated advancements of AI technologies in both medicine (MURA, CheXpert) and natural language processing systems (SQuAD). He received both my Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Computer Science from Stanford. His research has been published in top medical journals (Nature Medicine, PLOS Medicine) and top computer science conferences (ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, CHI), and covered by media outlets including NPR, Washington Post, and WIRED. With Andrew Ng, he designed and lead the AI for Healthcare Bootcamp at Stanford, where he has trained and mentored 58 Stanford students on AI for Healthcare research projects. In his undergrad, he co-founded Edusalsa, a course planning platform that has been used by over 4000 Stanford students. With Eric Topol, he writes Doctor Penguin, a weekly newsletter on AI for Medicine research read by thousands of experts.
