Basking under the soft glow
Of the winter sun
That dances round
The cold shadows
Cast by trees
Watching in silence
The well worn path
Of the passing breeze
That collects into a gust
   Of feelings
Tipped by a casual brush of hands
Snowballing into a sensation
Felt too strong
In the diaphlegmatic breath
I smell the trouble
When our eyes meet
For a moment
   I can hear your laugh
Perilously echoing
Around the chambers
Of my chest
Cavity without filling
Up the free corners
Of my mind
That would be willing
To let me walk
Towards you
Through this tempest
Of sense and desire.
