My six o’clock walk
A summer stroll down the few blocks
With two orders dinner and sparking water
Watch her light up seeing what I’ve brought her.

My six o’clock walk
Autumn leaves on the roadside flock
With one order dinner and sparking water
What would I do if I spot her?

My six o'clock walk
I scan the crowd around
Glimpses of her presence, her sight etched in memory
An ironic hope for serendipity, an intervention from the stars.

My six o’clock walk
A stroll through memories of the summer
With two orders dinner and sparking water
Knock on her door, and tell her all that the heart has in store.
