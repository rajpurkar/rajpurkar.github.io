Can you see
That I'm wearing purple too?
Las palabras, tres belles,
We're riffing poets, you and me two.
Dancing to tunes under the stars,
Do you see that together we're shining too?
Living and laughing, through the years,
Have you noticed there's magic in me and you?

On this ironic adventure
Without a wheel,
You've found yourself driving,
Finishing this story, a wrap and a seal.
In the tangles of life,
When we cross again,
I hope you'll see
If we're both in purple then.
