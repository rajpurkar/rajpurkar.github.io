<p>On this ironic adventure<br>Without a wheel,<br>You&#39;ve found yourself driving,<br>Finishing this story, a wrap and a seal.<br>In the tangles of life,<br>When we cross again,<br>I hope you&#39;ll see<br>If we&#39;re both in purple then.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Tempest </h2><h4>Feb 2019</h4><p><p>Basking under the soft glow<br>Of the winter sun<br>That dances round<br>The cold shadows<br>Cast by trees<br>Watching in silence<br>The well worn path<br>Of the passing breeze<br>That collects into a gust<br>   Of feelings<br>Tipped by a casual brush of hands<br>Snowballing into a sensation<br>Felt too strong<br>In the diaphlegmatic breath<br>I smell the trouble<br>When our eyes meet<br>For a moment<br>   I can hear your laugh<br>Perilously echoing<br>Around the chambers<br>Of my chest<br>Cavity without filling<br>Up the free corners<br>Of my mind<br>That would be willing<br>To let me walk<br>Towards you<br>Through this tempest<br>Of sense and desire.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Aftertaste </h2><h4>Jan 2019</h4><p><p>Oh sweet nectarine,<br>Twice tasted,<br>Linger on.</p>
<p>The tragedy of a memory,<br>Is in its peeling,<br>Layer by layer,<br>Until only the sprout remains.<br>Still, live on.</p>
<p>Let lips tell<br>Words mouths cannot.<br>Eyes show<br>Pulses of running thoughts.<br>Just another<br>Minute, Word, Taste,<br>let me lie,<br>That&#39;ll be enough.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>A Frame Option </h2><h4>Feb 2017</h4><p><p>Fingers running through golden streaks,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze fixed on the screen, wondering.<br>Elbows grazing, side by side,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minds out for a stroll, wandering.<br>Legs peeking out her white summer dress,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes seeking out a place to hide, unassuming.<br>Lips dare not get any closer again,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts cruising down the highway, only whispering. </p>
<p>Tossing, turning, awake in the dark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel the beat of a heart jolted<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;By a spark.<br>See her standing in the California sun,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear her paint the heart she has won.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Delete </h2><h4>Jul 2016</h4><p><p>A perfectionist<br>Trying to fix a blemish in the past.<br>An introspector<br>Mulling over the details that rippled fast.<br>A patient<br>Trusting in time and space to heal the pain.<br>A repentant<br>Trying to take back the words in vain.</p>
<p>I&#39;m no weightlifter<br>That can bench this shame away.<br>I&#39;m no doctor,<br>All I can do is trust and pray.<br>I’m no singer<br>With a good theme song to play.<br>I’m no player,<br>About to forfeit this game today.</p>
<p>A clock<br>Ticking away the moments so fine.<br>A calculator,<br>Adding and multiplying wrinkle lines of mine.<br>A typewriter,<br>Etching my thoughts, my mistakes don&#39;t mind.<br>A keyboard,<br>Got an delete key, became a master of rewind.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Your Puzzle </h2><h4>May 2016</h4><p><p>A fear of the clumsy fall,<br>To be expended and come to a halt.<br>Started with a sprint,<br>To get a head start in this marathon.</p>
<p>Climbing towards the mountaintop,<br>Looked back. See yourself waving back<br>From where you once stood.<br>You&#39;ve come far.</p>
<p>Progress, not change.<br>Not just through the mountains, but the valleys<br>Which pick you apart and jumble your pieces,<br>So that you can play your greatest puzzle.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that you came unprepared,<br>It&#39;s that the twists and turns threw you off.<br>Solace in that you&#39;re not racing alone, Lightning McQueen!
You&#39;ll see that these turns were made for drifting.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>If Only </h2><h4>May 2016</h4><p><p>Vivacious, the laughs of the heart.<br>Memorable, the hugs before the part.<br>Alive, the adventure without a wheel.<br>Unfinished, our story, no wrap and no seal.</p>
<p>Sailed, the current against the call.<br>Failed, the words that just couldn’t fall.<br>Strange, the feelings that missed their call to show.<br>Nervous, the heart that paced, no time to slow.</p>
<p>Forgotten, a flying spark can also flee.<br>Regret, a future we may never see.<br>Rewind, the rewrite I wish in time.<br>Gone, the story left unfinished, with a rhyme.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Fruits </h2><h4>Mar 2016</h4><p><p>What is your flavor,<br>Tangy, zesty, or sweet?<br>What are you at your pith,<br>Beneath the veneer of your peel?</p>
<p>And does your peel betray the flavor inside,<br>What do I know about you, what do you hide?<br>Soft inside your callous shell,<br>Hardened after that time you fell?</p>
<p>If we took the time to ripen,<br>Shed away our coats with time,<br>What beauty would be left in our flesh?<br>Would we find that our flavors meshed?</p>
<p>Whatever our flavors,<br>Tangy, zesty or sweet.<br>Let us be that at our piths,<br>Or we may never get a chance to feel.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Once Again </h2><h4>Mar 2016</h4><p><p>In their dreams they meet again,<br>Caught in surprise at each other’s sight.<br>Their pounding chests forced to unlock<br>The pain that has been tucked away<br>Like a todo item never checked off.</p>
<p>They struggle to maintain their poise<br>As they make their way to each other,<br>Their eyelids brimming<br>With memories of what they once were.</p>
<p>From a brief exchange of pleasantries<br>To an impassioned exchange of honesties,<br>They&#39;ve imagined all the words they never spoke,<br>All the time they never shared.</p>
<p>Not ones for goodbyes,<br>But never imagined the struggle to say hello.<br>Once the keepers of best secrets,<br>Now only silence in-between.</p>
<p>The beats of their hardened hearts<br>Perhaps still in synchrony.<br>Perhaps better left unchecked.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Check-In </h2><h4>Mar 2016</h4><p><p>Once again the familiar scent<br>Of the airport coffee shop,<br>Facing my airplane out the window.</p>
<p>As my coffee fuels me,<br>The airplane sips its own drink.<br>A brief respite well deserved,<br>And much needed.</p>
<p>A strange familiarity in our meet,<br>At the end of another chapter<br>The threads of our existences intertwine<br>Again and again for these brief moments.</p>
<p>Airport fantasies of free upgrades,<br>Unfulfilled by curt turndowns,<br>But dreams to travel first-class<br>As alive as ever.</p>
<p>A nostalgic familiarity then,<br>In the hopes shared by a younger self.<br>A little more cooked, a little more baked<br>But the dough no different now.</p>
<p>I wonder then of a future self,<br>Who will have lived chapters<br>Yet unknown and unread.<br>Sipping coffee by the window<br>In contemplation, checked in.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>The Waltz </h2><h4>Dec 2015</h4><p><p>Our hands clasp each other’s,<br>Soft smiles lighting up our faces.<br>Making conversation about our day<br>While our feet are in wait,<br>Tapping in anticipation for a count.</p>
<p>My back to the wall<br>And the waltz swings into motion,<br>Impatient feet relieved<br>To be dancing with the music<br>In sweet company.</p>
<p>And our feet in perfect harmony,<br>Flowing with each other’s movements,<br>A deceptive beauty hiding<br>The intricacy of the mechanics.</p>
<p>We may smile at each other<br>Quickly shy away from each other&#39;s gaze,<br>As we sail around the dance floor.<br>An unspoken link, hand in hand.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>In Search </h2><h4>Nov 2015</h4><p><p>In search for words that capture<br>Not what i wish to say<br>But what i wish to mean.</p>
<p>In embrace of vulnerability<br>Yet halted at the gates of a higher brain,<br>Once again in battle<br>With one that displays no reservations.</p>
<p>So how am I to answer<br>To the honesty<br>That permeates this code of words<br>With an open heart.</p>
<p>What am I afraid of?<br>Of being seen in a different light?<br>Or disappointing or being disappointed?<br>What do I have to lose<br>But my veneer?</p>
<p>At a loss for words:<br>My mind silent, but honest<br>To questions unanswered.</p>
<p>Walking towards each other<br>On a path of honest words,<br>Of unselfish smiles and meandering conversations,<br>In our openness,<br>I will meet you halfway.</p>
</p></div><div class="writing"><h2>Canvas </h2><h4>Nov 2015</h4><p><p>Today I paint you a picture<br>With words that flow<br>From a mind with much to say<br>To a pen that is wise<br>In draining its run<br>Little by little.</p>
<p>Before night seeps into day<br>It whistles with the winds<br>Tunes of a land far away<br>Where these words are to follow<br>Carrying answers to questions<br>Sung in soprano.</p>
<p>And the spaghetti that makes one and one two<br>Tangles the mind<br>In curiosity and wonder<br>Of a canvas unpainted<br>But patient in its wait;<br>Two brushes by its side.</p>
