title:         Cardiologist-Level Arrhythmia Detection
description:   Our deep learning algorithm exceeds the performance of board certified cardiologists in detecting a wide range of heart arrhythmias from electrocardiograms recorded with a single-lead wearable monitor. Dataset 500x larger than previously studied corpora used to train a deep convolutional neural network.
