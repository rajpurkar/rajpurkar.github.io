title:         CheXNeXt - Deep learning for chest radiograph diagnosis 
description:  We developed CheXNeXt, a deep learning algorithm to concurrently detect 14 clinically important diseases in chest radiographs. CheXNeXt's training process consists of 2 consecutive stages to account for the partially incorrect labels in the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We evaluated the algorithm against 9 practicing radiologists on a validation set of 420 images for which the majority vote of 3 cardiothoracic specialty radiologists served as ground truth. The algorithm achieved performance equivalent to the practicing radiologists on 10 pathologies, better on 1 pathology, and worse on 3 pathologies.
