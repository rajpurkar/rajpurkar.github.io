title:         SQuAD2.0
description:   SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 new, unanswerable questions written adversarially by crowdworkers to look similar to answerable ones. To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering. SQuAD2.0 is a challenging natural language understanding task for existing models, and we release SQuAD2.0 to the community as the successor to SQuAD1.
