title:         SQuAD
description:   Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage. With 107,785 question-answer pairs on 536 articles, SQuAD is significantly larger than previous reading comprehension datasets.
