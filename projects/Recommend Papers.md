title:         Recommend Papers
description:   Piloted for the Deep Learning Symposium at NIPS '15, Recommend-Papers was built in order to facilitate discussion of the most recent deep learning breakthroughs and explore an alternative mechanism for selecting presentations. In order to let the broader research community (including the authors of research papers) contribute to the discussion, Recommend-Papers allowed members to post papers and comment on them, and PC members to hold private discussions.
collaborators: Professor Andrew Ng, Professor Yoshua Bengio et al.
