title:         MRNet - Deep-learning-assisted diagnosis for knee MRI
description: We developed an algorithm to predict abnormalities in knee MRI exams, and measured the clinical utility of providing the algorithm’s predictions to radiologists and surgeons during interpretation. 7 practicing board-certified general radiologists and 2 practicing orthopedic surgeons at Stanford University Medical Center (3–29 years in practice, average 12 years) read a validation set of 120 exams twice, once without model assistance and once with model assistance, separated by a washout period of at least 10 days. We found that model assistance significantly reduced the rate at which healthy patients would be mistakenly diagnosed as having ACL tears.
