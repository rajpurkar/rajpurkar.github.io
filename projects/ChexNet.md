title:         CheXNet - Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection
description:   We develop an algorithm that can detect pneumonia from chest X-rays at a level exceeding practicing radiologists. Our model, CheXNet, is a 121-layer convolutional neural network that inputs a chest X-ray image and outputs the probability of pneumonia along with a heatmap localizing the areas of the image most indicative of pneumonia. We train on ChestX-ray14, the largest publicly available chest X-ray dataset. We find that the model exceeds the average radiologist performance at the pneumonia detection task on both sensitivity and specificity.
