title:         Chord Recognition
description:   Can a computer identify the chord I'm playing on a guitar simply by  listening to it? How well does machine learning perform on the task realtime? Could we leverage that technology to give realtime feedback to an instrument learner? This research presents a prototype of an online tool for real-time chord recognition. It fuses traditional techniques in machine learning with the capabilities of new web technologies such the the Web Audio API, and WebSockets.
